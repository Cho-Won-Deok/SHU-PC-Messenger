South Korea was placed 15th based on national competitive edge evaluation performed by WEF (World Economic Forum) which is two places higher than the last year.
According to Ministry of Economy and Finance (MOEF), South Korea was placed 15th out of 140 countries based on national competitive edge evaluation performed by WEF.
WEF has changed its evaluation method by applying changes in economic environment such as Industry 4.0 and global financial crisis. Based on WEF’s new index, South Korea jumped from 17th place to 15th place. Based on WEF’s old index, South Korea was placed 26th in 2017.
“Because some of evaluation’s items were changed drastically, it is somewhat difficult to compare last year’s ranking (26th) to this year’s ranking (15th) simply based on time.”
